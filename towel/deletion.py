"""
Helper module to circumvent Django's (arguably) broken formset saving behavior
where models are directly deleted even if ``commit=False`` is passed to the
formset's ``save()`` method.

Usage::

    class SafeModel(deletion.Model):
        # fields etc.


    instance = SafeModel.objects.get(...)
    with deletion.protect():
        instance.delete() # Does nothing
    instance.delete() # Actually deletes the instance!


Saving formsets::

    with deletion.protect():
        objects = formset.save()

    for obj in formset.deleted_objects: # Django provides this attribute
        obj.delete() # Or do something else, like checking whether the instance
                     # should really be deleted


This is achieved by overriding the model's ``delete()`` method with a different
version which does nothing if protection is active. If you override the
deletion method for some reason too, you have to ensure that the threadlocal
state is respected too.
