    Parses the request body into a format independent of its content type.

    Does nothing for the following HTTP methods because they are not supposed
    to have a request body:

    - ``GET``
    - ``HEAD``
    - ``OPTIONS``
    - ``TRACE``
    - ``DELETE``

    Otherwise, the code tries determining a parser for the request. The
    following content types are supported:

    - ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` (the default)
    - ``multipart/form-data``
    - ``application/json``

    The two former content types are supported directly by Django, all
    capabilities and restrictions are inherited directly. When using JSON,
    file uploads are not supported.

    The parsed data is available as ``request.POST`` and ``request.FILES``.
    ``request.POST`` is used instead of something else even for ``PUT`` and
    ``PATCH`` requests (among others), because most code written for Django
    expects data to be provided under that name.
